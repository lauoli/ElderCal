      <h1>Living Off Of Social Security Benefits In Gentrified Neigborhoods</h1>

      <p>Gentrification has exploded in the city, and in its wake, has left eldery residents who live off a fixed income, struggling to make ends meet.
      </p>
      <p>Neigborhoods such as Williamsburg and Central Harlem, which traditionally have been hotbeds for low-income residents, are seeing a surge of affluent newcomers.
      </p>
      <p>Supporters of gentrification argue that neighborhoods benefit from the influx of extra cash flowing into the area. Many aspects of everyday life are changed for the better; crime goes down, parks are renovated, vacant lots become urban gardens,
        etc.
      </p>
      <img src="img/map1.png" width="500px" height="500px"/>
      <p>Those against gentrification, remain skeptical of all these "benefits," since say the extra economic growth does little to serve the original residents of the neighborhood. They argue that residents are being priced out, forcing them to leave for
        other parts of the city or seek out higher paying paying jobs.
      </p>
      <p>But what if you can't do either?
      </p>
      <p>How are the elderly, who depend on social security benefits, coping with the changing landscape?
      </p>

      <p>The data here is not 100% accurate. Kinks are still being worked out.
